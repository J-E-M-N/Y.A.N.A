## Overview
### Description
- Share and/or receive positive message with other users

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Supportive Application
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer. Functionality wouldnâ€™t be limited to mobile devices, however the mobile version might be easier to design for.
- **Story:** Users will be able to click on a button to receive positive messages of encouragement. They can also write their own positive messages that other users might receive. It's nice to know that you are not alone, even in tough times like these.
- **Market:** We primarily want to target college students but because of the positivity of the app anyone can use it.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often as the user wants depending on what exactly they're looking for. It probably wouldn't be used every day, but it can definitely be used to help users who might need a bit of extra encouragement.
- **Scope:** We would start by targeting some Howard student groups and younger (college age and below).
